A regression test suite is a collection of test cases that ensures existing functionalities remain unaffected after new code changes or enhancements. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability and reliability of the application across releases. These tests are typically re-run after every deployment or update to catch any unintended issues early. Manual execution of such tests can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially in large systems. Thatâ€™s why, as part of our project, we are working towards the automation of this regression test suite to make the process faster, consistent, and scalable.
